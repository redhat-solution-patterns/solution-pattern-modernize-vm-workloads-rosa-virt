= Workshop

Here are the workshops which are already available on demo.redhat.com:

- https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=tril&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fsandboxes-gpte.virt-on-rosa-with-trilio.prod[Backup and Recovery of Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization VMs using Trilio (ROSA)]
- https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=factory&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fsandboxes-gpte.virt-on-rosa.prod[OpenShift Virtualization Migration Factory Demo (ROSA)]

Now we will be looking at our first scenario: Create Virtual Machines using GitOps on ROSA. 

- Installing the environment
* Create an environment using this https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=factory&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fsandboxes-gpte.virt-on-rosa.prod[link].
    
- Delivering the workshop

1. Login to the bastion host available in the above CI.

+
2. Now fork this https://github.com/gmidha1/virtdemos.git[repo] under your github account and after that clone the repo into the bastion host.
Configure oc cli using the admin logins.

+
3. Run ./bootstrap.sh from virtdemos directory. It will deploy the OpenShift GitOps operator.
+
4. After 2 mins, you will be able to see the OpenShift GitOps operator under Installed operators in OpenShift Console.
+

+
5. Now let us get the url from Routes under Networking for OpenShift GitOps server(ArgoCD) and open this url.
+

+
6. It will open the ArgoCD login screen, now click on “Login via OpenShift” and enter the credentials for OpenShift. After that we will see this screen:
+
image::ocp_virt_10.png[width=100%]
+
7. Now we will create a RHEL VM by creating an argocd app using this cli from virtdemos directory: oc apply -f apps/ap.yaml
+
image::ocp_virt_11.png[width=100%]
+
8. It will create an application in ArgoCD which in turn will create a RHEL Virtual Machine in OpenShift as shown in below images.
+
image::ocp_virt_12.png[width=100%]
+
image::ocp_virt_13.png[width=100%]
+
9. We can see this virtual machine from the OpenShift console -> Virtualization -> Virtual Machines and we can connect it to the VM using the password we provided in rhel vm yaml.
+

+
image::ocp_virt_16.png[width=100%]
+
image::ocp_virt_17.png[width=100%]
+
10. Now we have successfully deployed a RHEL VM using GitOps in OpenShift and are able to access it using the credentials.
