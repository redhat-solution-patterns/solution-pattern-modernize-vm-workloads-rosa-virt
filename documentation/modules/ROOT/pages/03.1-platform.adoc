== Walkthrough As a Platform Engineer

The ansible scripts we just run has setup the following as ArgoCD applicatiopns:

* Red Hat Connectivity Link/Kuadrant operator and a Kuadrant instance
* A TLS issuer for TLS certificates. [https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/cluster/cert-manager.io\~v1~ClusterIssuer/prod-web-lets-encrypt-issuer/yaml[View CR^]]

``` sh
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: prod-web-lets-encrypt-issuer
spec:
  acme:
    email: abc@example.com
    preferredChain: ''
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: le-production
    server: 'https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'
    solvers:
      - dns01:
          route53:
            accessKeyIDSecretRef:

            secretAccessKeySecretRef:
              key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
              name: ********
``` 

* TLS Issuer references to the ACME server  https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt^]
* It uses the DNS providers credentials, in this case AWS to create the TLS certificates
******
====

* A Gateway (based on istio gateway) with a wildcard hostname based on the root domain. [https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/ns/ingress-gateway/gateway.networking.k8s.io\~v1~Gateway/prod-web/yaml[View CR^]]

    kuadrant.io/lb-attribute-geo-code: EU
spec:

            kind: Secret
            name: api-tls
        mode: Terminate
``` 

* gatewayClassName refers to Istio as a the provider (Istio  has also been setup by the Ansible script)

* Various policies attached to the Gateway:
** A default `deny-all` Auth Policy to start with zero-trust [https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/ns/ingress-gateway/kuadrant.io\~v1beta2~AuthPolicy/prod-web-deny-all/yaml[View CR^]]

metadata:

  namespace: ingress-gateway
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: ingress-gateway
  rules:
    authorization:
      deny-all:
        opa:
          rego: "allow = false"
    response:
      unauthorized:
        headers:
          "content-type":
            value: application/json
        body:
          value: |
            {
              "error": "Forbidden",
              "message": "Access denied by default by the gateway operator. If you are the administrator of the service, create a specific auth policy for the route."
            }


``` 

* the target states that this AuthPolicy is attached to a specific Gateway
* AuthorizationRule in this case is based pon *opa* - Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego policy.
* You can define the response to be sent in the *response* section; in this case, a response has been defined for *unauthorized* requests

** TLS Policy [https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/ns/ingress-gateway/kuadrant.io\~v1alpha1~TLSPolicy/prod-web-tls-policy/yaml[View CR^]]

    name: prod-web-lets-encrypt-issuer
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: prod-web
``` 

* This policy uses the  CertificateIssuer to set up TLS certificates for the listeners defined within the Gateway. 
* The TLS certificate generated is attached to the Gateway as secret.
******
====

* A sample EchoAPI endpoint and it's HTTPRoute:
** This is service literally echoes the request and is just used here for testing purposes. [https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/ns/echo-api/gateway.networking.k8s.io\~v1~HTTPRoute/echo-api/yaml[View HTTPRoute^]]

      matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
``` 
* the *hostname* will be to access the service that is defined within *backendRefs*

=== Create a DNS Policy

Now that we have setup a secure, protected application connectivity environment, we are now ready to expose this to the Internet. We will do so by creating a DNSPolicy +

* Copy the following into the *Import YAML* utility accessible by the (+) button on top of the https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%[OpenShift Console^]
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1alpha1
kind: DNSPolicy
metadata:
  name: prod-web-dnspolicy
  namespace: ingress-gateway
spec:
  routingStrategy: "simple"
  targetRef:
    name: prod-web
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
----

* The DNSPolicy acts against a target Gateway by processing its listeners for hostnames and then create dns records for those hostnames. 
* Note that the *routingStrategy* is marked as *"simple"* because this is a single cluster deployment. But in case of multi-cluster deployments DNSPolicy allows for `routingStrategy: loadbalanced` and can optionally include loadbalancing specifications.
* The *targetRef* sections refers to the [https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/ns/ingress-gateway/gateway.networking.k8s.io\~v1~Gateway/prod-web/yaml[Gateway^]] created when the Ansible script was executed.
* A number of DNS records are created on AWS Route 53.

=== Echo API Walkthrough

WARNING: Due to the nature of DNS Records it may take a while for it get propagated. 

* Check if the HTTPRoute works as it should. Run this curl command from a terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
curl -k -w "%{http_code}" https://echo.globex.%AWSROOTZONE%
----

* The Output will look like this

```
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/",
  "query_string": null,
  "body": "",
  "headers": {
    "HTTP_HOST": "echo.%AWSROOTZONE%",
    ...
  }
  ..
}
```
* Now let us run this 10 times and see how this responds to `RateLimitPolicy` that was applied
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
for i in {1..10}; do curl -k -w "%{http_code}" https://echo.globex.%AWSROOTZONE%; done
----
* You would see that you will get a response 5 times, post which you would see *Too Many Requests 429*
* We haven't setup a RateLimitPolicy for the echoAPI itself, and so the gateway's default RateLimitPolicy gets applied to the echoAPI HTTPRoute. You can create another RateLimitPolicy and attach it to the echoAPI HTTPRoute to check this out.
