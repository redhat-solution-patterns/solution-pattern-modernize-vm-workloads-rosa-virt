== Solution Setup - Onboard ProductCatalog service endpoint

Now that the Platform Engineer has made the Gateway available, Developers/App owners can now onboard their application/service endpoints to be available for secure access. Application developers can self service and refine policies to their specific needs in order to protect their exposed service endpoints.

In this solution pattern, the Globex developers are now ready to onboard the ProductCatalog service to be securely exposed as an endpoint.

=== Run the deployment scripts

*  Run the Ansible script which will setup the `ProductCategory Service Endpoint` and `Globex Mobile app`. This also setups Red Hat build of Keycloak for SSO.

[#walkthrough]

== Solution walkthrough as a Developer

=== Test Globex Mobile app

* Access the Globex Mobile's Route from the *globex-apim-user1* namespace > Routes or click  https://globex-mobile-globex-apim-user1.%OPENSHIFTSUBDOMAIN%[here^]
* Login using `asilva/openshift` credentials; Click on `Categories` button on the homespage
* You should see a 404. This is because the ProductCatalog service-endpoint hasn't been exposed using a HTTPRoute
+

=== Set up HTTPRoute for ProductCatalog service-endpoint

* Copy the following into the *Import YAML* utility accessible by the (+) button on top of the OpenShift Console
* In this YAML replace the the `spec > hostnames` as show below

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
kind: HTTPRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: globex-mobile-gateway
  namespace: globex-apim-user1
  labels:
    deployment: globex-mobile-gateway
    service: globex-mobile-gateway
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - kind: Gateway
      namespace: ingress-gateway
      name: prod-web
  hostnames:
    - globex-mobile.globex.%AWSROOTZONE%
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: "/mobile/services/product/category/"
          method: GET
      backendRefs:
        - name: globex-mobile-gateway
          namespace: globex-apim-user1
          port: 8080
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: Exact
            value: "/mobile/services/category/list"
          method: GET
      backendRefs:
        - name: globex-mobile-gateway
          namespace: globex-apim-user1
          port: 8080
----

=== Test Globex Mobile again (after HTTPRoute is setup)

* Try accessing *Categories* again - you should see a 403.
+
image::globex-403.png[width=70%]

* This is because while you have the HTTPRoute now, the original deny-all default policy kicks in and doesn't allow any requests to made. We have a zero-trust auth in place!! 

=== Setup Authpolicy

* Copy the following into the *Import YAML* utility accessible by the (+) button on top of the OpenShift Console

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1beta2
kind: AuthPolicy
metadata:
  name: globex-mobile-gateway
  namespace: globex-apim-user1
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: globex-mobile-gateway
    namespace: globex-apim-user1
  rules:
    authentication:
      "keycloak-users":
        jwt:
          issuerUrl: https://sso.%OPENSHIFTSUBDOMAIN%/realms/globex-user1
    response:
      success:
        dynamicMetadata:
          identity:
            json:
              properties:
                userid:
                  selector: auth.identity.sub
  routeSelectors:
    - matches: []
----

=== Test Globex Mobile again (after HTTPRoute and AuthPolicy are setup)

* Try accessing *Categories* again - you should now be able to see the Categories.
+
image::globex-success.png[width=70%]

=== Test the default *RateLimit Policy*

* Try accessing *Categories* again - you should now be able to see the Categories.
* Click any of the Categories from the list, and then the *Categories* menu, and repeat this a few times.
* Expect to see a 429 error:
+
image::globex-429.png[width=70%]



=== Create a new RateLimit Policy which overrides default gateway policy

* Copy the following into the *Import YAML* utility accessible by the (+) button on top of the OpenShift Console

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
apiVersion: kuadrant.io/v1beta2
kind: RateLimitPolicy
metadata:
  name: globex-mobile-gateway
  namespace: globex-apim-user1
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: globex-mobile-gateway
    namespace: globex-apim-user1
  limits:
    "per-user":
      rates:
        - limit: 100
          duration: 10
          unit: second
      counters:
        - metadata.filter_metadata.envoy\.filters\.http\.ext_authz.identity.userid
----

=== Test Globex Mobile again (after HTTPRoute, AuthPolicy and RateLimitPolicy are setup)

* Try accessing *Categories* again - you should now be able to see the Categories.
* Click any of the Categories from the list, and then the *Categories* menu, and repeat this a few times.
* You would now see there is no 429 for up to 100 requests in a duration of 10 seconds.


== Conclusion

With this setup, Globex is all set to onboard further service enpoints to be accessed securely. This solution can be further extended to span across a multi-cluster setup too.

We will also extend this pattern to include the all important Observability aspects as well.
